## About

HackerUp is an HsHacks III project built by Nihal Talur and Dave Ho.

HackerUp lets developers meet each other through the app, allowing them
to see others nearby to join their projects and to view their online portfolios.
With the app, one can view the GitHub profiles of those around them to get a better idea
of their interests for possibly forming a programming team. It provides live updates on nearby
developers and their profiles.

Currently, we have a working implementation of the web app and the android app.
